# ðŸ”’ FLock LLM Loss Validator

[train.flock.io](https://train.flock.io/) is the gateway to FLock.io's decentralized AI training platform. Users must stake FML, FLock.io's testnet token deployed on Sepolia Base, to participate and earn staking rewards.

This project is a validator that computes the validation loss for a HuggingFace-compatible LLM. For more details, visit the [original project page](https://github.com/FLock-io/llm-loss-validator/tree/main).

## âš¡ Usage

To use the validator, obtain your `FLOCK_API_KEY` and `task_id` from [FLock](https://train.flock.io) and fill in the `deploy.yaml` file accordingly.
